to go to the class `CMD + click mouse`

to see superclass and subclass of current class then `Ctrl + H`

if method doesn't have params then lambda `() -> body`
if method has one param then lambda `a -> body`
if method has more than two then we should put paranthesis and types
`(String a, Integer n) -> body`

`this` -> is pointing to current object
